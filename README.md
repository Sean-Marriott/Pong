## Game

### Game - Difficulty

There are three levels of difficulty. These difficulties correlate to an increase in the ball's speed.
They are:
- 1 - Easy
- 2 - Medium
- 3 - Hard

### Game - Setup

1. On the welcome screen, the first player to press in their navswitch will be designated player 1.
2. Player 1 will now have to select a difficulty level described above.
3. To increase the game difficulty the navswitch is pushed in the north direction, or to decrease the game difficulty the navswitch is pushed in the south direction.
4. To select the difficulty push the navswitch in.

### Game - Playing
1. Both players can now move their paddles by pushing their switch in the north or south direction as desired. 
2. Players score by hitting the opponent's wall protected by their paddle.
3. If the wall is hit, the opponent will lose 1 out of their 3 lives and the ball will be reset.
4. Once a player loses all of their 3 lives the game will end.

### Game - End
1. Once the game has ended, a "W" will be shown on the winners screen and a "L" on the losers.
2. To restart the game, both players need to push their navswitches in.
3. The game will now restart from the "Setup" phase.
